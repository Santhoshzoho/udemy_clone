# udemy_clone
Description This repository contains a basic HTML and CSS implementation of a Udemy clone website. Inspired by the popular online learning platform, this project aims to mimic some of the core functionalities and design elements of Udemy.


Key Features
Responsive Design: The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Course Listings: Users can browse through various course listings with thumbnail images, titles, descriptions, and pricing information.

Course Details: Clicking on a course provides detailed information including the instructor's name, course duration, ratings, and a syllabus.

User Authentication: Although this version does not include backend functionality, it features a basic user authentication interface with login and registration forms.

Search Functionality: Users can search for specific courses using the search bar, providing a more streamlined browsing experience.

Static Content: All content is static and hardcoded into the HTML files for demonstration purposes. Future iterations could incorporate dynamic content retrieval from a backend database.
